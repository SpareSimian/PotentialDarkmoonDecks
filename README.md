# PotentialDarkmoonDecks
Display Darkmoon cards in one's inventory that could be used to create a full deck

Using the Altoholic DataStore database, list all Darkmoon cards
accessible to the current character. This is useful to determine which
cards need to be acquired (purchased or made) to complete a deck.

To use, simply type /pdd in chat. All cards found on the current
faction in connected realms (via Altoholic's database) are listed.
You'll need to visit all the places where cards might be stored (eg.
character banks and guild vaults) to populate the database. Shared
account data is included in the search.

This addon requires the installation of
[Altoholic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/altoholic) to
acquire the data.
